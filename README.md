# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form for user input and required fields
- CSS animation and transform
- Embedded media
- Git/Github utilization and familiarity

## Plan on improving the project

- It would have been good to require the need to step the increments in the date/time field in the form. It also makes sense to restrict the time input for reservations to 5 to 15 min intervals. As is, the user has to either type the time, or scroll through each minute individually to set the time.
